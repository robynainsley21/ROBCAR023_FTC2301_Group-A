# IWA8 Challenge 1

## About 
Solve the bugged code so that it logs the objects `leo` and `sarah` and their postal codes to the console.
#

## Requirements to solve challenge:
- Ensure that the syntax for the objects are correct
- Do not change the values of the variables
- Add a nested object to both the `leo` and  `sarah` objects that contains all address-specific information:
  - street name
  - house number
  - postal code
- All values in the main objects should be reassigned from the variables at the top of the file. The only exception is the new `age` value that is added to the object
#

- 🤵Leo
