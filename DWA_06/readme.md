# DWA6: Abstraction

## About✏️
Starting with a working version of the 'Book Connect' website used in the IWA capstone, make the code more maintainable, extendable and easier to change by using objects and functions as abstractions.

## Requirements📃
- Abstraction (in the form of functions and objects)
- Documentation (JSDoc)
- Approved styleguides
- Use files from either initially provided repository, or continue working from your own version, ensuring that all data is correctly exported
